During Adam's suspension,
he had lots of fun.


On the first day,
he went to the karaoke.
He finally got to belt MCR tunes out loud.
He sang his heart out when "Teenagers" came on.
"They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me,"
this line rang true. 
He went home feeling fulfilled.


On the second and third day,
he played video games non stop.
He played Call of Duty, Valorant, League of Legends,
Dungeons and Dragons, and Identity V.


On the fourth and fifth day,
he binge-watched Netflix.
He watched Wednesday, Lucifer, Stranger Things and
Riverdale.


On the sixth and seventh day,
he slept like a log.
No amount of noise could rouse him,
not even the neighbour's drum kit.
