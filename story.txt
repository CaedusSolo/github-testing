Adam wakes up in the morning.
He brushes his teeth.
He takes a bath.
He has breakfast.
Then he checked Instagram.
Adam gets scolded by the teacher, because he forgot to do his homework.

At recess, 
Adam bought fried rice at the canteen.
It was so good that he ordered another bowl.

At tuition,
Adam was confused. 
He didn't understand accounting.
The double-entry system confused him.
He didn't grasp the concept of debit and credit.
He knew deep down, he was screwed.

At home,
Adam got scolded by his mom.
He didn't do the dishes like he was asked to.
